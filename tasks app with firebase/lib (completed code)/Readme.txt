Hi there!
This is only the lib folder for completed project. 
By this lib folder you cannot run your project.
Watch the tutorial and install Firebase CLI for your platform (MacOS or Windows)
This lib folder is provided in case you want to compare your code with mine.
I suggest follow all the tutorials and don't skip any part.
